# md5sum
MD5 Checksum generator &amp; checker


Usage : 
Generate md5 checksum : ./file -generate /directory/of/files/
Check original md5 checksum agains new : ./file -check /directory/of/files/ location_to_original_md5

Generated order of md5 hashes matters, on the next version am going to add new features where ordering wont matter unless you have new files created, where you are going to have to check md5 hashes before adding new files, or just specifiy in a text file the new created files.
